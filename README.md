Game Flow Summary
In this game, we start off with a home screen which includes the options of play, help, or quit. This home screen will also appear when the game is paused. If the player chooses quit, the game ends and the player is given their score. If the player chooses help, the player is given instructions to help them play the game. Once the player chooses play, the game begins at level one.

Each level of the game presents new challenges and progressively gets harder. Level one starts with the player only shooting asteroids coming at them. Level two adds more asteroids and a few enemy ships. As the player progresses through the game the asteroids get faster and the level of the enemy ships increases. 

To complete the game, the player must finish all levels without getting shot by an enemy ship or colliding with an asteroid. The player is always given their score when they complete the game or when the player dies.

Look and Feel
Arcade style first person space shooter game with a top-down approach. The game is set in a space theme with upbeat music.

Gameplay and Mechanics

Game Progression
The player advances through the game by completing levels. During each level the player achieves points.

Mission/challenge Structure
The challenge or mission is to avoid incoming asteroids and getting shot at by opponent space ships. The player should try and shoot them in order to score points, so that the game could progress to the next level.

Objectives 
The player aims to achieve high scores for each level and not getting hit by enemy fire or asteroids. The player also must complete each level to win the game.


Play Flow 
The player progresses forward through space as the asteroids and enemy ships come toward. The player maneuvers the ship to avoid getting hit and to shoot the asteroids and enemy ships.

Mechanics 
The player’s ship is in a space universe. It is a 2D world where the player has control of their ship in four directions. The player’s ship is a rigid object which can be destroyed if hit by fire or collision. The player controls the ship to fire at enemy objects as well as to avoid getting hit. The enemy objects are also rigid and are destroyed by the player’s fire. The rules of the game are the player must not be hit by enemy fire or objects. The player can do this by avoiding the objects or shooting them. The player must also complete each level to win the game.

Physics 
The game is 2d so there is no gravity. The objects move on a single plane in four directions. The objects in the game can collide with the player and vice-versa. Player and enemy fire are rigid objects which can destroy whatever they hit. 

Movement in the game
Player’s Spaceship moves side to side and up/down while asteroids and other ships move towards it.

Objects 
Spaceship is a rigid object that is affected by enemy fire or collision with asteroid/ship. Other objects are affected by the player fire.

Actions
Game actions are controlled by player input. The player moves the ship with up, down, left, and right arrows or a joystick. The space key is used to fire and the esc key is used to pause. On a joystick, the fire button fires and the start button pauses.

Combat
The player only combats with enemy ships.

Screen Flow
Basically, we will have two screens. The first screen is the landing screen of the game which contains help instructions for the game, a play button, and a quit button. Player is navigated to the second screen when he/she clicks on the play button, which is the game screen where the player actually plays the game. 

Game Options

Replaying and Saving
The player can pause and restart the game but no saving.

Cheats and Easter Eggs
